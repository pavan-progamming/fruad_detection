# Fraud Detection

## Project Description

The Fraud Detection smart contract is a decentralized system designed to combat fraudulent activities in the blockchain ecosystem. This community-driven platform allows users to report suspicious activities, provide evidence, and collectively verify fraud reports through a transparent voting mechanism. The system maintains fraud scores for addresses and helps identify high-risk entities in the decentralized space.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a trustless, community-governed fraud detection system that enhances security across the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging collective intelligence and economic incentives, we aim to build a comprehensive database of fraudulent activities that can protect users from scams, rug pulls, and other malicious activities in the DeFi and Web3 space.

## Key Features

### 🔍 **Fraud Reporting System**
- Users can submit detailed fraud reports with supporting evidence
- Stake-based reporting ensures serious submissions only
- IPFS integration for storing evidence documents securely
- Immutable record keeping on blockchain

### 🗳️ **Community-Based Verification**
- Decentralized voting mechanism for report validation
- Prevents single points of failure or manipulation
- Economic incentives for accurate voting
- Transparent resolution process

### 📊 **Fraud Scoring Algorithm**
- Dynamic fraud scores assigned to addresses
- Cumulative scoring system for repeat offenders
- Risk-based classification (low, medium, high risk)
- Public API for third-party integrations

### 💰 **Economic Incentives**
- Stake requirement for submitting reports (prevents spam)
- Rewards for accurate fraud reporting
- Penalties for false accusations
- Self-sustaining economic model

### 🛡️ **Security Features**
- Multi-signature voting requirements
- Owner emergency controls for stuck reports
- Protection against self-reporting and voting manipulation
- Transparent fund management

## Core Functions

### 1. `reportFraud(address _suspectedFraudster, string _description, string _evidenceHash)`
- **Purpose**: Submit a new fraud report with evidence
- **Requirements**: Minimum stake of 0.01 ETH
- **Features**: 
  - Records detailed fraud information
  - Stores IPFS hash of evidence
  - Prevents self-reporting
  - Emits fraud report events

### 2. `voteOnReport(uint256 _reportId, bool _support)`
- **Purpose**: Community voting on submitted fraud reports
- **Requirements**: Must not be reporter or accused party
- **Features**:
  - One vote per address per report
  - Automatic resolution when threshold met
  - Transparent voting tracking
  - Status updates during process

### 3. `getFraudScore(address _address)` / `isHighRisk(address _address)`
- **Purpose**: Query fraud scores and risk levels
- **Features**:
  - Public fraud score lookup
  - High-risk address identification
  - Integration-friendly API
  - Real-time score updates

## Future Scope

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Hardhat or Truffle
- MetaMask wallet
- Test ETH for deployment

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>
```

### Usage Examples
```javascript
// Report fraud
await fraudDetection.reportFraud(
  "0x123...", 
  "Ponzi scheme detected", 
  "QmHash123...", 
  { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01") }
);

// Vote on report
await fraudDetection.voteOnReport(1, true);

// Check fraud score
const score = await fraudDetection.getFraudScore("0x123...");
const isRisky = await fraudDetection.isHighRisk("0x123...");
```
